# **Rubik Cube Project**
## Overview & Goals
### Overview
This project scope is an application that should be able to solve a rubik's cube, have a user interact with the application to solve the cube, and digitize images of the cube. Another objective of this project is to normalize the use of github and libraries for projects. 

Almost all aspects of this document will change in the near future
